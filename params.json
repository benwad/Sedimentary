{"name":"Sedimentary","tagline":"A Sed patterns organiser for Mac","body":"### What is Sedimentary?\r\n\r\nSedimentary is a Mac app for keeping track of your most commonly-used [sed](http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) patterns.\r\n\r\n```sed``` commands are notoriously confusing to look at - once you've got a pattern right, you want to keep it around in case you want to use it again. Sedimentary lets you store a table of patterns, along with their flags and any helpful notes you make about them. You can then specify an input and output file and run the command from within the GUI.\r\n\r\n### What is ```sed```?\r\n\r\n```sed``` stands for 'stream editor' - it is a powerful tool used to manipulate text coming from an input stream. ```sed``` is generally run from a UNIX command line - the user specifies a pattern which acts as a rule for processing the input stream. The stream can then be output to the standard output, or an output file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
